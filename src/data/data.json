    "paragraph": "Welcome to my final project for ALX Software Engineering! This 3D ray-casting game is developed using SDL2 and C, chosen for their low-level access to hardware and graphics, as well as for learning purposes regarding game development and ray tracing."
  },
  "About": {
    "paragraph": "This project was inspired by a passion for game development and a desire to learn low-level programming with SDL2 and C. It is a Portfolio Project for Holberton School. You can find more about Holberton School ",
    "Why": [
      "I like puzzles, and creating a maze game allows me to design intricate puzzles for players to solve.",
      "Developing a 3D game is challenging, but challenges help us grow. It pushes me to learn and improve my skills."
    ],
    "Why2": [
      "C is a great language , C++ is lovely too, making a game in either is so exciting",
      "Raycasting is so fun"
